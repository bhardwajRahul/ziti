# Contributing

NetFoundry welcomes all and any contributions. All open source projects managed by NetFoundry share a common
[guide for contributions](https://docs.openziti.io/policies/CONTRIBUTING.html).

If you are eager to contribute to a NetFoundry-managed open source project please read and act accordingly.

Some bookkeeping needs to be done for contributions.

- Log an issue and tie your commits to it. Make sure the issue title clearly describes the problem, and the body of the issue explains what is happening, what is expected, and how to reproduce it.
- Ensure your commit messages in Git include `fix openziti/ziti#<issuer-number>` as the first line of the commit message, followed by a blank line, and then whatever detail you want to provide.
- Include in the pull request the same text, `fix openziti/ziti#<issue-number>` either in the title or body.
- Ensure commits are signed by a key you've associated with your GitHub handle.
